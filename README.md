## Description

Welcome to the **Project Cost Management API**, your go-to solution for efficiently managing and controlling all aspects of project costs.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Cost Calculation**: Accurately calculate the total cost of projects by separately managing the costs of supplies and professionals. This ensures a clear and detailed breakdown of project expenses.

- **Supplies and Professional Segmentation**: Organize and categorize both supplies and professionals within your projects. By segmenting costs by category, you can easily track and analyze the expenses associated with specific categories, providing more granular insights into your project’s financials.

- **Unit Cost Management**: Define and manage unit costs for both supplies and professionals. This allows for precise cost estimations and adjustments based on the specific resources used in each project.

- **Project-Based Cost Structuring**: Create multiple projects, each with its own set of supply categories and professional categories. This feature supports the simultaneous management of multiple projects, with the ability to track and compare costs across different projects and categories.

- **Category-Specific Cost Tracking**: For each project, track the costs associated with specific categories of supplies and professionals. This functionality provides a deeper understanding of where resources are being allocated and helps identify potential cost-saving opportunities.

- **Real-Time Cost Analysis**: Generate up-to-date reports that reflect the current financial status of your projects. With real-time data, project managers can make informed decisions quickly, ensuring that projects stay within budget.
